# 2D Ising Predictor


## This repo is currently a work in progress and as such data, models and results among other files are currently unavailable. 

This is a repository dedicated to creating and developing machine learnt models to predict nucleation rates for the 2D Ising model. The aim is to create a user friendly package that is able to train and save models (provided that appropriate data is supplied) which can potentially be applied to systems that they were note specifically trained on.
